                Chicken, (Gallus gallus), any of more than 60 breeds of
                medium-sized poultry that are primarily descended from the wild
                red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus, family Phasianidae, order
                Galliformes) of India. The chicken is perhaps the most widely
                domesticated fowl, raised worldwide for its meat and eggs.
                Despite the chicken’s close relationship with the red jungle
                fowl, there is evidence that the gray jungle fowl (G.
                sonneratii) of southern India and other jungle fowl species,
                also members of Gallus, may have contributed to the bird’s
                ancestry. There is some debate about what the chicken’s
                scientific name should be. Although many taxonomists and
                ornithologists consider it as a domesticated form of the wild
                red jungle fowl, some classify it as a subspecies of the red
                jungle fowl (i.e., G. gallus domesticus), whereas others,
                including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, classify the bird
                as G. domesticus.Chickens have a squat and rounded appearance.
                They stand less than 70 cm (27.6 inches) tall and weigh
                approximately 2.6 kg (5.7 pounds) on average. Males (called
                cocks or roosters) and females (hens) are known for their fleshy
                combs, lobed wattles hanging below the bill, and high-arched
                tails. In some roosters, the tail can extend more than 30 cm (12
                inches) in length.Chickens breed in the spring and summer
                months. Egg laying is stimulated by the long stretches of
                daylight that occur during the warmer months; however,
                artificial lights placed in chicken coops can trigger a hen’s
                egg laying response throughout the year. The time between
                ovulation and egg-laying is approximately 23–26 hours.
                Subsequent ovulations may occur within an hour after the
                previous egg was laid, allowing some hens to produce as many as
                300 eggs per year.Fertilized embryos develop quickly, and chicks
                hatch approximately 21 days later. Chicks are born covered in
                down, but they mature quickly, becoming fully feathered after
                four to five weeks. At about six months, males produce viable
                sperm, and females produce viable eggs. Members of free-ranging
                flocks may live for six to eight years under the best
                conditions, but most chickens used in the poultry industry serve
                as egg layers for two to three years before being slaughtered
                for their meat, with much of it being used in pet food. Chickens
                in captivity have been known to live for up to 30
                years.Fertilized embryos develop quickly, and chicks hatch

                five weeks. At about six months, males produce viable sperm, and
                females produce viable eggs. Members of free-ranging flocks may

                been known to live for up to 30 years.Chicken domestication
                likely occurred more than once in Southeast Asia and possibly
                India over the most recent 7,400 years, and the first
                domestications may have been for religious reasons or for the
                raising of fighting birds. Descendants of those domestications
                have spread throughout the world in several waves for at least
                the last 2,000 years. For most of that period, chickens were a
                common part of the livestock complement of farms and ranches
                throughout Eurasia and Africa. Only in the early 20th century,
                however, did chicken meat and eggs become mass-production
                commodities.Modern high-volume poultry farms, with rows of cages
                stacked indoors for control of heat, light, and humidity, began
                to proliferate in Great Britain about 1920 and in the United
                States after World War II. Females (mature hens and younger
                chickens, called pullets) are raised for meat and for their
                edible eggs. Farmers have developed numerous breeds and
                varieties to fulfill commercial requirements.
